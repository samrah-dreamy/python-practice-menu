## 📌 Project Description

This program displays a menu that allows the user to choose between three different exercises:

1. **Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle**
2. **Print the multiplication table of a given number**
3. **Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 0 to 100**
4. **Exit the program**

Each question is implemented in a **separate Python module** and imported into the main menu file.
